## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Insta-king.git
cd Insta-king

Create and activate a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Ensure your requirements.txt contains:
Flask==2.3.3
colorama==0.4.6

Run the Flask server:
python3 Insta-king.py

Open your browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5001/

Login attempts will be logged in login_attempts.log and printed in the console with a colored box.

Handling "Port Already in Use"

If the server complains that port 5001 is busy, you can kill it with:
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i :5001) 2>/dev/null || true

Then rerun the server:
python3 Insta-king.py
